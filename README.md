# Youtube-Analysis-on-Tableau
## This project is based on a dataset from Youtube containing the amount of youtubers, the different categories of videos, the amount of views, the level of income earned, all in different parts of the world and so on.
## I used Tableau in the analysis of this dataset to compare variables such as; the most watched Youtubers, subscriber growth over a particular period of time, highest paid Youtubers, unemployment rate in different countries and their Youtube earnings and so on. 
## This project was done recently and was a criteria for me to get my certification as a data analyst.
